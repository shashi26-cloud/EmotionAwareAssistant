# Emotion-Aware Study Assistant

A Flask-based web application that analyzes your emotional state through facial recognition and voice analysis to provide personalized study recommendations.

## Features

- **Real-time Emotion Detection**: Uses DeepFace and TensorFlow to analyze facial expressions via webcam
- **Voice Tone Analysis**: Analyzes voice patterns and stress levels through microphone input
- **Personalized Study Recommendations**: Provides tailored study tips based on detected emotional state
- **Session History Dashboard**: Track all past analysis sessions with detailed breakdowns
- **Comprehensive Emotion Breakdown**: Shows percentage distribution of detected emotions

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Emotion Detection**: DeepFace, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Voice Analysis**: SpeechRecognition, PyAudio, Librosa
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Data Storage**: JSON files for session history

## Dependencies

- Flask >= 2.3.3
- opencv-python >= 4.8.1
- deepface >= 0.0.79
- tensorflow >= 2.13.0
- tf-keras (for TensorFlow 2.20+)
- SpeechRecognition >= 3.10.0
- pyaudio >= 0.2.11
- librosa >= 0.10.0
- numpy >= 1.24.3
